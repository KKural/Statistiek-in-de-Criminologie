For Final Answers:

vraag_a (should be 0.86):

0.0086 (forgot to convert to percentage)
86 (multiplied by 100 too many times)
0.13 (calculation error)
vraag_b (should be 8.08):

0.0808 (correct probability but not converted to percentage)
91.92 (complement error - calculated P(X > 32))
80.8 (multiplied by 100 twice)
vraag_c (should be 96.41):

0.9641 (correct probability but not converted to percentage)
3.59 (forgot to take complement)
103.59 (added instead of taking complement)
964.1 (multiplied by 100 twice)

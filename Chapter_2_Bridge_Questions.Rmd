# Chapter 2 Bridge Questions - Multi-Level Concept Reinforcement

## Exercise Set 1: Basic to Advanced Recognition (Mixed Difficulty)

### Question 1: Simple Recognition (BASIC)
**Scenario:** A police officer records the eye color of suspects: brown, blue, green, hazel.

**Question:** What measurement level is eye color?

A) Nominaal - categories without order
B) Ordinaal - categories with order
C) Interval - numeric with equal distances
D) Ratio - numeric with true zero

**Correct Answer:** A
**Basic Rationale:** Eye colors are simply different categories with no natural ordering.

### Question 2: Practical Application (INTERMEDIATE) 
**Scenario:** You're analyzing crime data and need to decide how to measure "time of day when crime occurred." You could use:
- Option 1: Exact time (14:23, 09:47, etc.)
- Option 2: Time periods (morning, afternoon, evening, night)

**Question:** What's the key trade-off between these approaches?

A) Option 1 is always better because more precision is always good
B) Option 2 is always better because it's simpler to analyze  
C) Option 1 gives precision but may obscure meaningful patterns; Option 2 loses precision but may highlight patterns
D) There's no real difference between the two approaches

**Correct Answer:** C
**Intermediate Rationale:** This reflects real analytical decisions - sometimes categorizing continuous variables helps reveal patterns (like "evening crime spike") that get lost in precise measurements.

### Question 3: Conceptual Understanding (INTERMEDIATE)
**Situation:** A student argues: "Number of arrests is ratio level because you can say someone with 4 arrests has twice as many as someone with 2 arrests."

**Question:** Is this reasoning correct?

A) Yes, the math works so it's ratio level
B) No, arrests don't have a meaningful zero point
C) Yes, but only if we're measuring arrests in the same time period
D) The reasoning is correct, and this is why ratio level enables more statistical techniques

**Correct Answer:** D
**Intermediate Rationale:** The student's reasoning is actually sound - number of arrests does have a meaningful zero (no arrests) and ratios are meaningful. This demonstrates good understanding of ratio level properties.

### Question 4: Tricky Situations (INTERMEDIATE-ADVANCED)
**Real-world problem:** Prison sentences in Belgium are recorded as "6 months," "1 year," "18 months," "2 years," etc. A researcher wants to analyze the relationship between sentence length and recidivism.

**Question:** How should sentence length be treated and why?

A) Nominaal - because they're just different categories of sentences
B) Ordinaal - because longer sentences are "more" than shorter ones, but intervals aren't equal
C) Interval - because the differences between sentences have meaning (6 months vs 1 year)
D) Ratio - because there's a meaningful zero (no sentence) and you can calculate meaningful ratios

**Correct Answer:** D
**Intermediate-Advanced Rationale:** This is ratio level because "0 months" is a meaningful zero (no punishment), differences are equal (6 months vs 1 year = same difference as 1 year vs 18 months), and ratios make sense (2 years is twice as long as 1 year). This is a practical example students might encounter.

### Question 5: Numbers as Labels (BASIC-INTERMEDIATE)
**Common mistake:** A student sees that football jersey numbers (1, 7, 10, 23, etc.) are numbers and concludes they must be interval or ratio level.

**Question:** Why is this incorrect?

A) Jersey numbers can't be negative, so they can't be interval or ratio
B) Jersey numbers are just identifiers - player #10 isn't "more" than player #7
C) Only whole numbers can be ratio level, not decimals
D) Jersey numbers should be treated as ordinal because higher numbers are better

**Correct Answer:** B
**Basic-Intermediate Rationale:** This reinforces the crucial concept that numbers used as labels/identifiers don't have quantitative meaning. Just because something uses numbers doesn't make it quantitative.

---

## Exercise Set 2: Mixed Applications and Analysis

### Question 6: Quick Recognition (BASIC)
**Simple question:** Which of these is definitely a qualitative variable?

A) Age of offender
B) Type of crime (violent, property, drug, etc.)
C) Number of prior arrests  
D) Sentence length in days

**Correct Answer:** B
**Basic Rationale:** Type of crime consists of categories/qualities, while the others are all quantitative (numbers with mathematical meaning).

---

### Question 7: Understanding Research Question Types (INTERMEDIATE)
**Scenario:** "Is there a difference in recidivism rates between male and female offenders?"

**Question:** What type of research question is this?

A) Univariate descriptive - describing recidivism
B) Bivariate descriptive - comparing two groups
C) Bivariate explanatory - testing if gender causes recidivism  
D) Multivariate - involving multiple variables

**Correct Answer:** B
**Intermediate Rationale:** This compares recidivism rates between two groups (male vs female) but doesn't claim gender *causes* recidivism - it's descriptive comparison, not explanatory causation.

---

### Question 8: Practical Decision Making (INTERMEDIATE)
**Dilemma:** You're studying public attitudes toward police. You could measure "trust in police" as:
- Option A: Yes/No question
- Option B: 5-point scale (very low, low, neutral, high, very high)
- Option C: 0-100 slider scale

**Question:** What should guide your choice?

A) Always pick the most precise (Option C) for better statistics
B) Always pick the simplest (Option A) for clearer results
C) Consider your research goals, audience, and analysis plans
D) It doesn't matter - they all measure the same thing

**Correct Answer:** C
**Intermediate Rationale:** The "best" measurement depends on context - simple yes/no for policy decisions, 5-point for balanced detail, 0-100 for complex modeling. Good researchers match measurement to purpose.

---

## Exercise Set 3: Error Analysis (Analyze Level)

### Question 8: Student Error Identification
**Student Answer:** "Age in years is ordinaal because you can put ages in order from youngest to oldest."

**Question:** What's wrong with this reasoning?

A) Age cannot be put in order
B) The student confused ordinal with nominal
C) Age has equal intervals and a true zero, making it ratio level
D) Age should be measured in categories, not years

**Correct Answer:** C
**Rationale:** Student focused only on ordering property, missed equal intervals and meaningful zero

---

### Question 9: Common Classification Error
**Student Answer:** "Student ID numbers (1001, 1002, 1003...) are ratio level because you can subtract them and get meaningful differences."

**Question:** Why is this incorrect?

A) You cannot do math with ID numbers
B) ID numbers are just labels - Student 1003 is not "more" than Student 1001
C) ID numbers should be ordinal, not ratio
D) Only whole numbers can be ratio level

**Correct Answer:** B
**Rationale:** Numbers used as identifiers don't have quantitative meaning

---

## Exercise Set 4: Design Critique (Evaluate Level)

### Question 10: Research Design Comparison
**Three studies measure recidivism:**
- Study A: Yes/No (did they reoffend?)
- Study B: Categories (no reoffense, minor reoffense, major reoffense)  
- Study C: Exact number of new offenses (0, 1, 2, 3, 4...)

**Question:** Which design provides the most analytical power and why?

A) Study A - clearest and simplest to understand
B) Study B - provides good balance of detail and simplicity
C) Study C - allows for the widest range of statistical analyses
D) All three are equally good for analysis

**Correct Answer:** C
**Rationale:** Ratio-level data (Study C) allows all statistical techniques that the others allow, plus more

---

### Question 11: Variable Transformation Impact
**Question:** A researcher initially measured "education level" as years of education (8, 12, 16, 18 years) but later decides to group them into categories (elementary, high school, bachelor's, graduate). What is lost in this transformation?

A) Nothing - both provide the same information
B) The ability to calculate precise averages and correlations
C) The ability to create frequency tables
D) The ability to compare groups

**Correct Answer:** B
**Rationale:** Converting from ratio to ordinal loses precision and some analytical capabilities

---

### Question 12: Measurement Level Choice
**Scenario:** You're designing a study on fear of crime. You could measure it as:
- Option 1: "Are you afraid of crime?" (Yes/No)
- Option 2: "How afraid are you?" (Not at all, slightly, moderately, very, extremely)
- Option 3: "Rate your fear level" (0-100 scale)

**Question:** What are the trade-offs between these approaches?

A) Option 1 is always best because it's clearest
B) Option 3 is always best because it provides most information
C) Option 2 balances simplicity with reasonable detail
D) The choice depends on your research goals and analytical needs

**Correct Answer:** D
**Rationale:** Each approach has advantages - the best choice depends on the specific research context and intended analyses

## Exercise 5.1 - Traffic Fine Probability (Normal Distribution)

### Question A - Detailed Steps

#### z1_a (correct answer: -3)
- `3` → sign error
- `-22.5` → forgot to divide by σ
- `22.5` → forgot division and wrong sign
- `-0.4` → divided by wrong value

#### z2_a (correct answer: -2.33)
- `2.33` → sign error
- `-17.5` → forgot to divide by σ
- `-0.31` → divided by wrong value

#### p_z1_a (correct answer: 0.0013)
- `0.9987` → complement error
- `0.13` → percentage instead of decimal
- `1.3` → comma/dot confusion

#### p_z2_a (correct answer: 0.0099)
- `0.9901` → complement error
- `0.99` → percentage instead of decimal
- `9.9` → comma/dot confusion

#### verschil_a (correct answer: 0.0086)
- `-0.0086` → wrong order subtraction
- `0.0112` → added instead of subtracted
- `0.0013` → used only first probability
- `0.0099` → used only second probability

### Final Answers

#### vraag_a (correct answer: 0.86)
- `0.0086` → forgot to convert to percentage
- `86` → multiplied by 100 too many times
- `0.13` → calculation error

#### vraag_b (correct answer: 8.08)
- `0.0808` → correct probability but not converted to percentage
- `91.92` → complement error - calculated P(X > 32)
- `80.8` → multiplied by 100 twice

#### vraag_c (correct answer: 96.41)
- `0.9641` → correct probability but not converted to percentage
- `3.59` → forgot to take complement
- `103.59` → added instead of taking complement
- `964.1` → multiplied by 100 twice

**Note:** These should trigger all the different diagnostic messages in the feedback system!
